If you're like me, you might think to yourself, "hey I could totally make this library that others and I can re-use when building Cloudflare Workers", and you get all the way to the end, go to test it, and see everybody's favorite TypeScript error:

This happens because the [`@cloudflare/workers-types`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-types) package doesn't export its type definitions; which is why you need to reference them in your project's `tsconfig.json` file as global types.

[Issue #195](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-types/issues/195) has been opened to fix this, but because there is no timeline for completion and no ability to submit a PR (the type definitions are automatically generated), I created this package as a stopgap.

## Installation

```bash
# NPM
npm install cloudflare-workers-types-esm
# Yarn
yarn add cloudflare-workers-types-esm
# PNPM
pnpm install cloudflare-workers-types-esm
```

## Usage

Import (or export) the types as needed

```ts
import { KVNamespace } from "cloudflare-workers-types-esm";

export type MySpecialSnowflake = KVNamespace<string>;
```

## Updates

`cloudflare-workers-types-esm` is automagically kept in sync with `@cloudflare/workers-types` with a GitHub Action workflow that runs hourly. When Cloudflare releases a new version of their type definitions, `cloudflare-workers-types-esm` will be updated to match it within an hour or so. That way, you don't have to wait on some unreliable maintainer to do stuff for you 👀
